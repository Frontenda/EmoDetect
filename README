EmoDetect

A project that enables computers to identify human emotion.

The code is available under the terms of the GNU GPL v3, or, at your option,
any higher version of the GNU GPL.

The code is offered without any warranty, in the hope that it may help
future efforts in the field of emotion detection.

EmoDetect uses OpenCV (opencv.org) for most of the image processing and
machine learning related tasks.

We've trained classifiers on over 10,000 images from the MUG Facial
Expression Database (http://mug.ee.auth.gr/fed); the trained classifiers
are available in the data/xml folder.
